#### Organizational structure

GitHub, Inc. was originally a [flat organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_organization) with no middle managers; in other words, "everyone is a manager" \([self-management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_self-management)\).[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#cite_note-cto-mgmt-style-15) Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them \([open allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_allocation)\), but salaries were set by the chief executive.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#cite_note-nyt-16)\[[needs update](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items)\]
